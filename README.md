## Introduction
  
Implementation of an ensemble of Recommander systems algorithms using Netflix data. The implemented models can be found in [Koren's article](https://www.cs.rochester.edu/twiki/pub/Main/HarpSeminar/Factorization_Meets_the_Neighborhood-_a_Multifaceted_Collaborative_Filtering_Model.pdf). The last model of the article is entitled **Integrated Model**. He won the Netflix Award in 2008.
    
* The models to implement are: 
* 1. Baseline Estimates described in the **2.1**  section of the article; 
* 2. Correlation-Based Neighborhood described by the (3) equation in the   **2.2**  section; 
* 3. Correlation-Based Neighborhood with implicit data described by the (10)  equation in the **3**  section; 
* 4. SVD ++ described by the equation (15)  in the section **4** ; 
* 5. Integrated Model described by the (16) equation in the **5** section.
